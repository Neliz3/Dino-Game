# Dino Game

#### Dino Game is inspired by Google's "Dinosaur game" and [Zippy library](https://github.com/ZippyCodeYT/Zippy_Codes/blob/91101085194ba2f30c74a82639b4730d52bb76dc/dinoGame.py). Created using [Ursina Engine](https://www.ursinaengine.org/).
The essence of the game is to overcome obstacles (cacti, vultures) with a character (dinosaur).

[Pyinstaller](https://pyinstaller.org/en/stable/) was used for creating .exe file.
